```{r}
library(nycflights13)
library(tidyverse)
```
```{r}
filter(flights, month==1, day==1) %>%
  arrange( desc(air_time))
```
##
```{r}
filter(flights, dep_delay > 60)

```

```{r}
filter(flights, dest == "HOU"| dest == "IAH")
```

```{r}
filter(flights, carrier %in% c("AA","UA","DL"))
```

```{r}
filter(flights, month %in% c(7,8,9))
```

```{r}
filter(flights,dep_delay >= 60 & arr_delay <= (dep_delay - 30))
```

```{r}
filter( flights, between(dep_time,0,600))
```

```{r}
filter(flights, is.na(dep_time))
```

other values are NA because if they never took off they cant have a airtime, delays, or etc
